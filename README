It is a small script to split *.flac and *.ape files to *.flac tracks with *.cue sheet.

To run this script you need ffmpeg, shnsplit, cuetag and cuebreakpoints installed.

Unfortunately, there is no error checking, so this script can possibly damage your files, be careful!

To split you should run "./bash_split.sh NAME.cue NAME.flac(.ape)"
